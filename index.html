    <h1>Pakistani Cuisine</h1>
    <p>Pakistani cuisine can be characterised as a vibrant blend of regional cooking styles and flavours from across South, Central and Western Asia,
        as well as ingredients, recipes and techniques borrowed from the Indian Subcontinent, Persian cuisine and Arabic cuisine.
