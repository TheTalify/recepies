    <img src="Images/karahi.jpg">
    <p>Chicken karahi (known as gosht karahi when prepared with goat or lamb meat instead of chicken), or kadai chicken, is a chicken dish from Pakistan. 
        It is noted for its spicy taste and is notable in Pakistani cuisine.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>chicken</li>
        <li>ghee (clarified butter)</li>
        <li>tomatoes</li>
        <li>paprika</li>
        <li>coriander</li>
        <li>2 tbsp garlic</li>
        <li>1 tbsp coriander powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chili</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ginger minced</li>
        <li>1 bulb garlic minced</li>
        <li>onions</li>
        <li>1 tbsp crushed black pepper</li>
        <li>cumin powder</li>
        <li>green chilies</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil into the pan, then put a dollop of ghee. </li>
        <li>Add the chicken in. Fry this, stirring constantly until the chicken begins to take on a golden colour in some places </li>
        <li>Add in the minced ginger and garlic. Give this a fry alongside the chicken. </li>
        <li>Continue to fry this until the raw smell of the ginger and garlic begins to fade</li>
        <li>Add all the chopped tomatoes and spices. Stir in and allow this all to cook on high</li>
        <li>Continue to cook this mix for about 20 minutes. The oil will separate, the tomatoes will thicken and begin to coat the chicken</li>
        <li>If the gravy is too thick add little bit of water before covering it. The masala should fuse well with the chicken.</li>
        <li>Add the coriander and green chillis, stir in, turn the heat down to a low flame and allow everything to simmer together for 5 minutes without putting the lid on</li>
        <li>Serve with the matchstick-cut ginger and additional coriander/green chilli and BOOM chicken korma. Enjoy!</li>
